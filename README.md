# Remove-WooCommerce-Free-Shipping
Plugin that unsets WooCommerce's free shipping.

I wrote this plugin because I was having issues disabling the Free Shipping Module in WooCommerce's settings page.
This does one thing, and one thing only - remove's free shipping, even if it's enabled in the settings page.
